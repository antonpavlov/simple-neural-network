# simple-neural-network
Example of a simple neural network from Udacity's Introduction to Neural Network course. Implementation of Backpropagation in C++.

# Objective
My objective is to implement in C++ a Backpropagation algorithm for multi-layer neural network from Python files. So, for now, it is an empty repo.

# License
Some files are distributed under different licenses:
* *binary.csv* belongs to UCLA and can be downloaded from here: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv Please, ask them regarding rights of its usage.
* *all python files* are from Udacity's course Introduction to Neural Networks. Please, ask them regarding rights of their usage. I also highly recommend that course if you want to learn about neural networks, or as a refresher to get in shape on this topic.
* *all C++ and headers* that I going to share here will be available under MIT license which I found to be one of the most permissive licenses for software.
